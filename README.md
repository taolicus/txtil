# TXTIL
Composable ASCII texture editor.

For the moment this is just a naive script to overlay and offset `.txt` files over one another.

## Usage
Run `node run.js` to print the rendered composition to the console.

Add `.txt` files to `/txt` and edit `layers.js` to set the order of layers and their position offset.

## Roadmap
- Translate symbols
- Extend a pattern over a canvas
- Generate random noise from a set of symbols with weights
- ???
